# physics

(beta) Here we provide several small physics modules covering different basic or advanced topics, written in both Python and C/C ++.

## Liquid Crystals

Modules that simulates liquid crystals. It includes:

- Isotropic-Nematic transition for a Liquid Crystal using Lebwohl-Lasher model

## Statistical Physics

Generic statistical methods to be used in solid state physics, e.g. phase transitions. It includes:

- Ising Model
- Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo for Lennard-Jones gas-liquid transition
