# physis

Physis (in Greek φύσις) is the first and fundamental reality, the principle and the cause of all things, according to the pre-Socratic philosophers. The term is typically translated as "nature".

The idea behind this package is to provide various modules and tools dealing with natural phenomena being the main subject of physical and chemical sciences.

## Modules

At the moment the package contains a few Python modules, which I coded for the statistics courses I attended during the master's degree course in computational physics at the University of Modena.

I plan to refactor these modules and write the most computationally demanding sections in C/C++. I wil also implement new physical modules, work and time permitting.

### Solidstate

Contains classes to manage periodic crystalline structures. It includes:

- Cell and Lattice generation
- Crystal class to manage the most common operations on periodic structures

### Statistics

Generic statistical methods to be used in solid state physics, e.g. phase transitions. It includes:

- Ising Model
- Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo for Lennard-Jones gas-liquid transition

### Liquid Crystals

Modules that simulates liquid crystals. It includes:

- Isotropic-Nematic transition for a Liquid Crystal using Lebwohl-Lasher model

## About Me

I am currently a PhD student in "Physics and Nanosciences" at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. I am a computational physicist working in the field of nanotribology and materials science. I am also an IT enthusiast and expert in programming optimized scientific code. 

My research activity is focused on the study of innovative lubricants, in order to reduce friction and wear in industrial technologies. I am working at the University of Modena together with Prof. Maria Clelia Righi, who collaborates closely with R&D departments of multinational industries. My work mainly concerns the development of softwares and codes for scientific applications and high-throughput analysis, using different programming languages (Python, C, Fortran).

I have a Master Degree in Computational Physics and I focused my University education on semiconductors, nanoscience, and tribology fields and technologies.
